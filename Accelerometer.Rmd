```{r}
library(rlist)
```

## Data preprocessing

Read data
```{r}
data_path = "HMP_Dataset"
num_action = 0
# element n is the actual name of class n
class_to_actions = list()
data_matrix = list()
index = 0

# each row is a file, the first element of a row is its class(1-16), the rest are flattened (through each time unit) 3 dimension data

for (action in list.files(path = data_path)){
  action_path = paste(data_path, action, sep = "/")
  num_action = num_action + 1
  class_to_actions[actions] = action
  
  for (file in list.files(path = action_path)){
    file_name = paste(action_path, file, sep = "/")
    data = read.table(file_name)
    index = index + 1
    data_matrix[[index]] = c(num_action, as.list(t(data)))
  }
}
```

Segment data
```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
